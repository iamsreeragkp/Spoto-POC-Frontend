# Sporto POC – API Documentation

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:4000` (set by `PORT` in `.env`)
**Auth:** none. **Format:** JSON (`Content-Type: application/json` for POST/PUT/PATCH). **CORS:** enabled for all origins.

## Conventions

- **Naming:** all request and response fields are `snake_case`. Query-string filter names are `camelCase` (e.g. `minOverallScore`).
- **Dates:** `YYYY-MM-DD` strings. **Times:** `HH:MM:SS`. `created_at` / `updated_at` are ISO timestamps.
- **Scores** (`overall_score`, `score_*`, …) are integers 0–10 (the data currently uses 3–6).
- **Numeric averages** (`avg_overall_score`, `avg_potential_score`) come back as **strings** like `"4.50"` – convert with `Number()`.
- **Multi-value text** (`physical`, `mental`, `technical`, `tactical`, `deadball`, `x_factor`) are comma-separated strings of tags, e.g. `"Acceleration, Agility – quick feet, Turns"`.
- **Updates:** `PUT` and `PATCH` behave identically – only the fields you send are changed. An empty string `""` is saved as `null`.
- **Unknown body fields** return `400`. `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` and the joined/read-only fields cannot be set.

### Success shapes

| Case | Shape |
|---|---|
| Single record (GET one / POST / PUT / PATCH) | `{ "data": { ... } }` (POST returns `201`) |
| List | `{ "data": [ ... ], "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 175, "totalPages": 9 } }` |
| Sub-resource lists (`/:id/reports`, `/teams/:id/players`) | `{ "data": [ ... ] }` (not paginated) |
| Delete | `{ "message": "players deleted", "id": 12 }` |

### Error shape

```json
{ "error": "Missing required field(s): name", "details": null }
```

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 400 | invalid id, missing required field, unknown field, bad date/number format, score outside 0–10, invalid `sortBy`, invalid JSON |
| 404 | record or route not found |
| 409 | duplicate unique `name`, or a foreign key points to a non-existent row (e.g. bad `team_id`) |
| 500 | unexpected server error |

### Common list query params (all list endpoints)

| Param | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | 1 | |
| `limit` | 20 | max 200 |
| `search` | – | free-text, case-insensitive "contains" across the key columns listed per resource |
| `sortBy` | per resource | allowed values listed per resource, otherwise `400` |
| `order` | `asc` | `asc` or `desc` |

Text filters marked *contains* are case-insensitive partial matches; the others are exact matches.
